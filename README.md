**Simple GUI-based RAR password recovery tool (dictionary attack).**

---

## Description
This is a minimal, easy-to-use application intended to help recover lost or forgotten passwords for your own `.rar` archives using a **dictionary (wordlist) attack**. The program provides a basic graphical interface: select the RAR file, select a wordlist, then start/stop the attack while viewing progress.

---

## Features
- Minimal graphical user interface (easy to use)  
- Dictionary-based password attempts (user-supplied wordlists)  
- Progress indication and basic logging  
- Intended for personal recovery and educational use only

---

## Quick Usage
1. Open the application.  
2. Click **Browse** and select the `.rar` archive you own.  
3. Click **Browse** and select a dictionary/wordlist file (`.txt`) (one password per line).  
4. Click **Start**. The app will try each word from the list until the correct password is found or the list ends.  
5. When the password is found, it will be shown in the UI and written to the log.

> Example (for CLI-style reference only — GUI is primary):

# Not an actual tool command — for conceptual reference only
python recover.py --archive "C:/path/to/file.rar" --wordlist "C:/path/to/wordlist.txt"
